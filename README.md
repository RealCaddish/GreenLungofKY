# Kentucky Parks Green Lung Project 
What's the amount of park space per person by county? This repo aims to create a choropleth map of how much park space is available per capita in each county in the bluegrass. This project seeks to find how much park space is available to residents of a given county in Kentucky utilizing OSM parks data as well as the U.S. Census Bureau's TIGER population database.
