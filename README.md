# Kentucky's Green Lung Project

##Examining parks per person in the Bluegrass

What's the amount of park space per person by county in the bluegrass? Perhaps a look into Bangkok Thailand can provide an answer to that question. Take a look at a fairly recent example From NASA's Earth Observatory in 2014. Bangkok's <i> Bang Kachao </i> region, nicknamed a green lung, serving as a lush artery of greenspace at the heart of the city's 8.8 million population:

 So what about pockets of green space in the beautiful hamlets of Kentucky? Although there are many ways to approach it, I think a simple spatial analysis solution can give us a decent reflection on looking at this question. Bang Kachao's Green Lung is a much more lush and humid climate than Kentucky's parks. But examining the measurement of park area per capita could provide means to understanding a comparison between the two.   
  I think that a proper examination of Kentucky's <i> green lungs </i> through population data can lend us a reflection on how municipalities value their parks and people. This repo aims to create a choropleth map depicting park space per capita by county. Statewide population data from the US Census Bureau's <i>TIGER/Line</i> database provides county-wide population data from the latest official census records. OpenStreetMap will also be cleaned and added to Q. I'd like to know just how much park area there is per person. This is a fairly straightforward exercise that I hope will provide a clean and simple workflow for aggregating this type of data.
  
Honestly, I want to know more of your thoughts about it. Could this project be extended to use the data measured again county municipal taxes per capita too? I'm curious what your thoughts are and if you think this can be expanded.
