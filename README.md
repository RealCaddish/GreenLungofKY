# Kentucky's Green Lung Project
##Examining parks per person in the Bluegrass
What's the amount of park space per person by county in the bluegrass? Recent work from NASA's Earth Observatory in Bangkok, Thailand's <i> Bang Kachao<i> area was given the nickname, a <i> green lung <i> that serves as a lush artery of greenspace for the city:

  This repo aims to create a choropleth map of how much park space is available per capita in each county in the bluegrass. This project seeks to find how much park space is available to residents of a given county in Kentucky utilizing OSM parks data as well as the U.S. Census Bureau's TIGER population database.
